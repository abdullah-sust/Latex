\section*{Summary}
Software systems always change during development and use. Bugs are discovered
and have to be fixed. Configuration management (CM) is concerned with the policies, processes, and
tools for managing changing software systems. Configuration management is useful for individual projects as it is easy for one
person to forget what changes have been made. The configuration management of a software system product involves four
closely related activities:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Change management
	\item Version management
	\item System building
	\item Release management
\end{itemize}

Configuration management is sometimes considered to be part of software
quality management (covered in Chapter 24), with the same manager having
both quality management and configuration management responsibilities. When
a new version of the software has been implemented, it is handed over by the
development team to the quality assurance (QA) team.
Main task is to know the essential functionality that must be provided by a version
management system, and the relationships between version
management and system building.
